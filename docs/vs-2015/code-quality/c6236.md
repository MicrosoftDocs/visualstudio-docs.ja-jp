[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning C6236: (\<expression> &#124;&#124; \<non-zero constant>) is always a non-zero constant  
  
 This warning indicates that a non-zero constant value, other than one, was detected on the right side of a logical OR operation that occurs in a test context. Logically, this implies that the test is redundant and can be removed safely. Alternatively, it suggests that the programmer may have intended to use a different operator, for example, the equality (`==`), bitwise-AND (`&`) or bitwise-XOR (`^`) operator, to test for a specific value or flag.  
  
 This warning is not generated for the common idiom when the non-zero constant is 1, because of its use for selectively enabling code paths at compile time. However, the warning is generated if the non-zero constant is formed by an expression that evaluates to 1, for example, 1 + 0.  
  
## <a name="example"></a>例  
 This code shows how warning C6236 can appear. Because `INPUT_TYPE` is not 0, the expression `n || INPUT_TYPE` is always non-zero, and the `else` clause is never executed. However, `INPUT_TYPE` is a constant with a value other than one, which suggests that it is meant as a value for comparison:  
  
```  
#define INPUT_TYPE 2  
#include <stdio.h>  
  
void f( int n )  
{  
   if ( n || INPUT_TYPE ) // analysis warning C6236  
   {  
      puts( "Always gets here" );  
   }  
   else  
   {  
      puts( "Never enters here" );  
   }  
}  
```  
  
 The following code instead uses a bitwise-AND (`&`) operator to test whether the `INPUT_TYPE` bit of the input parameter `n` is set:  
  
```  
#define INPUT_TYPE 2  
#include <stdio.h>  
  
void f( int n )  
{  
   if ( n & INPUT_TYPE ) // no warning  
   {  
      puts( "Bitwise-AND comparison is true" );  
   }  
   else  
   {  
      puts( "Bitwise-AND comparison is false" );  
   }  
}  
```
